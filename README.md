# Yo, I'm Stan 👋

College kid. Gamer at heart, coder by accident.

## About Me
Sup! I'm just your regular student who takes Android modding way too seriously (but not really). If I'm not messing with configs or breaking stuff, I’m probably grinding some games because let’s be real, life without games is boring as hell.

## Fun Facts
- Can mod Android while rage quitting ranked matches. Multitasking, baby.
- Bugs? Nah bro, that’s “advanced features.”
