## 🚀 What's Good?

- 🎓 So, I'm actually on the grind studying Religious Education (yeah, not exactly a dev major, right? 😂).
- 🌱 But hey, I'm super hyped about coding, even though I'm still basically a noob!
- 💡 Super into diving deep into new stuff I don't know yet (ambitious much? Maybe!).
- 💬 Hit me up to chat about anything tech, maybe some Eminem lyrics, or just life stuff.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Idk, honestly, my life ain't that exciting, but I'm trying to change that!
